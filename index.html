<h1>Example teletext frames</h1>
<p>
Many teletext artists and designers are producing teletext frames and pushing
the boundaries of what can be done with the technology. This
site serves as an archive of example frames, from which users of edit.tf can
start experimenting. There is one page per artist or designer
linked below. Each page
displays a set of frames. By clicking on any frame, the user will be taken to
the editor with the frame already loaded. The examples archive is updated 
near-daily.
</p>
<p>There are a total of <strong>549</strong> frames here, by the following artists and designers:
<a href="zxguesser/">Alistair Cree</a> (7 frames), 
<a href="andyuglifruit/">Andy Jenkinson</a> (26 frames), 
<a href="beefax/">beefax</a> (12 frames),

Artists and designers can easily submit their frames for inclusion. There
are no particular requirements for inclusion. Tweet your editor URL to
<a href="https://twitter.com/edit_tf"></a> or email it to a
maintainer. Another very simple way is to bring up the export menu in the
editor with <code>Esc-E</code> and click the link to tweet the frame into
this archive.
