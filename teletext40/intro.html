teletext40 was a project to make a new teletext service online
that anyone could contribute to. It was started in Setember 2014.
It was only available on the web, was a little clunky, required
people to email their frames to us, but it generated the frames
you see below. Many of these frames were made at public events
by teletext beginners.

The teletext community has grown since then. Now we have the excellent
<a href="http://teastop.plus.com:8080/">Teefax</a>, which can
be uploaded to by anyone and can be displayed on real teletext
televisions using a Raspberry Pi.
